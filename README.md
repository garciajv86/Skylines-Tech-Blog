## Installation

This app requires the MySQL database to be installed on your computer, I provided links below.<br>
[MySQL_Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

## Usage

To use this app you must first log into your MySQL database and run the schema.sql file located in the db folder. Once you have ran the schema you can than quit MySQL. Now you must run the command npm run seed to seed your database. Once the database is seeded you then can run the command npm start to allow you the server to start listening. Once the server is listening you can open the insomnia app and start making request, a demo of how to do so is in the link above under Link titled E_Commerce_Backend.
